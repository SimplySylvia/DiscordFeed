> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED: DiscordFeed is No Longer Supported
>
> **This project is now deprecated and should not be used for new development.**
>
> <details>
> <summary>Why?</summary>
>
> Due to limitations in the Discord API, it is not possible to aggregate messages for users across multiple servers/channels on their behalf unless a dedicated bot is invited to every server and channel the user wishes to aggregate.
> Discord does **not** allow:
>
> - Polling or aggregating server messages via OAuth2 or user tokens (this is against Discord's Terms of Service and technically restricted).
> - Accessing server messages for a user unless your application is a bot and is explicitly invited to each server/channel.
>
> **This means:**
>
> - You cannot build a "universal Discord inbox" or message aggregator for arbitrary users/servers without requiring every user to install your bot in every server/channel they want to aggregate.
> - The only supported way to access server messages is via a bot with the correct permissions, which is not feasible for a general-purpose aggregator.

## Authentication Flow

DiscordFeed uses secure Discord OAuth2 authentication for user login and authorization. The authentication system is built with NextAuth.js, leveraging JWT sessions and Redis for token management. For a detailed step-by-step overview of the OAuth flow, see [User Authorization & OAuth Flow](./docs/user-authorization.md).

---

## Message & Channel Indexing

DiscordFeed uses a background queue-based system to efficiently index your Discord servers, channels, and messages. When you log in, the app checks if your servers and channels are already indexed. If not, it triggers a background process that fetches your server and channel data from Discord, stores it in the database, and schedules message aggregation jobs. Messages are fetched both on a schedule and in real-time via webhooks, and unread counts are calculated using message timestamps and your last read position. For a detailed breakdown of this process, see [Message & Channel Indexing Flow](./docs/indexing.md).

## Database Usage

This project uses **PostgreSQL** as its primary database, managed through the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM. Prisma provides type-safe database access, schema migrations, and a modern query builder for Node.js and TypeScript. All data models, relationships, and migrations are defined in the [`prisma/`](./prisma) directory.

- **ORM**: Prisma Client is auto-generated from the schema and used throughout the backend for safe, efficient queries.
- **Migrations**: Database schema changes are tracked and applied using Prisma Migrate.
- **Schema**: The full data model and entity relationships are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma).
- **Visual ERD**: For a full entity relationship diagram and more Prisma-specific documentation, see [`prisma/README.md`](./prisma/README.md).

## Scalability and Load Balancing

DiscordFeed is architected for horizontal scalability and robust load balancing at every layer of the stack. Here's how the application achieves this:

### Application Layer

- **Next.js 15 (Edge/Serverless):** The app leverages Next.js 15, supporting both edge and serverless runtimes. This enables horizontal scaling by running multiple stateless instances across a global CDN or serverless infrastructure (e.g., Vercel, AWS Lambda).
- **Hybrid Rendering:** Combines static server routes (for fast initial loads) and dynamic client/server components (for interactivity and real-time updates), reducing backend load for static content and scaling dynamic content as needed.
- **Stateless API Routes:** API routes are stateless and can be deployed behind a load balancer to distribute incoming HTTP requests across multiple instances.

### Data Layer

- **PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres):** Used for persistent storage. PostgreSQL can be scaled vertically (larger instance) or horizontally (read replicas, sharding for very large scale).
- **Redis (Vercel KV):** Used for caching, rate limiting, and as a message queue backend. Redis is highly performant and can be clustered for high availability and throughput.

### Message Aggregation & Job Queue

- **Bull Queue (with Redis):**
  - Distributed processing: Multiple worker processes (or containers) can pull from the same queue, enabling horizontal scaling of background jobs.
  - Retry/backoff: Failed jobs are retried with exponential backoff, and persistent failures are logged for monitoring.
  - Priority & scheduling: Jobs can be prioritized and scheduled (e.g., high-priority channels polled more frequently).
  - Monitoring: Bull Board provides a dashboard for monitoring and managing jobs.

### Caching & Rate Limiting

- **Redis Caching:** Frequently accessed data (like recent messages per channel) is cached in Redis, reducing database and API load.
- **Rate Limiting:** Both API requests to Discord and internal endpoints are rate-limited using Redis, preventing overload and handling Discord's strict rate limits.

### Real-Time & Webhooks

- **WebSocket & Webhooks:** Real-time updates are delivered via WebSockets and Discord webhooks, reducing the need for constant polling and enabling efficient, event-driven updates.

### Edge Network & CDN

- **Global CDN Distribution:** Static assets and edge functions are distributed globally, reducing latency and offloading traffic from the origin server.

### Load Balancing Strategies

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Multiple instances of the app (API and workers) can be run in parallel, either as containers (Docker/Kubernetes) or serverless functions.
- **Distributed Workers:** Any number of worker processes can be started (locally or in the cloud), all pulling from the same Bull/Redis queue. This allows the system to handle spikes in message aggregation or processing load.
- **Managed Services:** Use managed PostgreSQL and Redis services with support for scaling, replication, and failover.
- **CDN and Edge Functions:** Leverage CDN and edge functions for static assets and edge-optimized API routes.
- **Monitoring and Autoscaling:** Monitor and autoscale based on queue length, API response times, and resource utilization.

#### Summary Table

| Layer        | Scalability Feature            | Load Balancing Approach          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Frontend/API | Next.js Edge/Serverless        | Platform/Cloud load balancer     |
| Background   | Bull Queue + Redis             | Multiple distributed workers     |
| Database     | PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM)        | Read replicas, sharding, pooling |
| Cache/Queue  | Redis (caching, rate limiting) | Redis clustering, managed Redis  |
| Real-time    | WebSocket, Webhooks            | Event-driven, not polling-heavy  |

**In summary:** DiscordFeed is designed for robust, cloud-native scalability and can handle high load by distributing work across multiple stateless services, background workers, and managed infrastructure components. Load balancing is achieved at both the application and background processing layers, coordinated via Redis and managed by the hosting/cloud platform's load balancer.

---

## Testing

This project uses **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and integration testing, and **Playwright** for end-to-end (E2E) testing with full TypeScript support.

### Running Tests

To run all unit and integration tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing with Playwright

**Playwright** is used for E2E browser testing. E2E tests are located in the `e2e/` directory and cover authentication, navigation, feed, settings, and more.

#### Running E2E Tests

1. **Ensure your development server is running:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **(First time only) Set up authentication state:**
   - Run the following command to open a browser and log in via Discord:
     ```bash
     npx playwright test e2e/auth.setup.spec.ts --headed --project=chromium
     ```
   - Complete the login in the browser window, then resume the test in the Playwright UI. This will save your authentication state to `e2e/.auth/user.json`.
   - You only need to do this once, unless you delete the `.auth/user.json` file.
3. **Run all E2E tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```
   or directly:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test e2e
   ```

#### Notes

- The E2E tests will use the saved authentication state for logged-in scenarios.
- If you need to reset authentication, delete `e2e/.auth/user.json` and repeat step 2.
- Playwright tests can be run in headless or headed mode. For debugging, add `--headed`.
- To run a single test file or test, use:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test e2e/feed.spec.ts
  ```

### Test Setup

- **Jest** is configured for TypeScript using `ts-jest`.
- **React Testing Library** is used for component testing.
- **Playwright** is configured for E2E browser testing.
- The test environment is set to `jsdom` for browser-like testing (unit/integration).
- All test files should use the `.test.ts`, `.test.tsx`, or `.spec.ts` extension and can be placed next to the components or in a `__tests__/` or `e2e/` directory.

### Installing Test Dependencies

If you need to install test dependencies manually, run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event identity-obj-proxy jest-environment-jsdom playwright @playwright/test
```

### Example Test Scripts in package.json

```json
"scripts": {
  // ...other scripts
  "test": "jest",
  "test:e2e": "node e2e/auth-setup.js && playwright test"
}
```

### Configuration Files

- `jest.config.js`: Jest configuration for TypeScript and React Testing Library.
- `jest.setup.ts`: Jest setup file for extending Jest matchers.
- `playwright.config.ts`: Playwright configuration for E2E tests.
- `e2e/auth-setup.js`: Script to ensure authentication state is set up before running E2E tests.

For more details, see the configuration files in the project root and the `e2e/` directory.

## Bull Board: Queue Monitoring

For local development, you can monitor all Bull queues (including message aggregation) using Bull Board:

### Launch Bull Board

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/bull-board.ts
```

This will start a dashboard at [http://localhost:3001/admin/queues](http://localhost:3001/admin/queues) where you can view, retry, and manage jobs.

**Note:** Bull Board is for local/dev use. For production, secure access or run Bull Board as a separate, protected service.
