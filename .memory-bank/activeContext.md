## Next Immediate Steps

- Install additional dependencies (@auth/prisma-adapter, ioredis, bull, jose)
- Create Prisma schema according to the design document
- Configure NextAuth.js provider for Discord OAuth2
- Implement Edge middleware for token validation
- Create background job system for channel indexing
