# DiscordFeed: Creative Phase Summary

## Phase 1: OAuth2 Authentication and Channel Indexing

This document summarizes the key design decisions made during the creative phase for Phase 1 of the DiscordFeed project.

## ðŸŽ¨ Authentication Design

We selected a **Hybrid Approach with Edge Middleware** for authentication, leveraging NextAuth.js with Discord OAuth2 and JWT tokens.

### Key Features:

- Edge middleware for fast token validation
- Redis for storing Discord tokens separately from JWT
- Proper scope handling and token refresh
- Balances security and performance

### Why This Approach:

- Best performance with edge validation
- Scalable architecture for thousands of users
- Secure token management
- Efficient session handling

## ðŸŽ¨ Database Schema Design

We selected a **Normalized Schema with Separate LastRead Table** to track users, servers, channels, and read status.

### Key Features:

- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper relationship modeling with Prisma
- Optimized indexes for common queries
- Support for user preferences and customization

### Why This Approach:

- Most flexible design for future features
- Maintains data integrity through proper relationships
- Efficient querying with appropriate indexes
- Scales well with growing user base

## ðŸŽ¨ Channel Indexing Strategy

We selected a **Priority-based Progressive Indexing** approach to efficiently fetch and track Discord channels.

### Key Features:

- Prioritizes important servers/channels
- Progressive loading for better UX
- Background job queue for rate limit handling
- Resilient error handling and retries

### Why This Approach:

- Best balance of immediacy and completeness
- Respects Discord API rate limits
- Scales well with large numbers of servers
- Provides good user experience

## Implementation Steps for Phase 1

1. **Database Setup**

   - Create Prisma schema with all models
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Generate initial migration
   - Seed database for testing

2. **Authentication System**

   - Configure NextAuth.js with Discord provider
   - Implement Edge middleware for token validation
   - Set up Redis for token storage
   - Create login page and protected routes

3. **Discord API Integration**

   - Build Discord API client with rate limiting
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Set up webhook handlers
   - Add error handling

4. **Channel Indexing**
   - Create background job queue
   - Implement prioritization logic
   - Build channel fetching and storage
   - Add progress tracking

## Dependencies Required

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@auth/prisma-adapter": "^1.0.0",
    "next-auth": "^4.24.5",
    "discord.js": "^14.14.1",
    "@prisma/client": "^5.7.1",
    "ioredis": "^5.3.2",
    "bull": "^4.10.4",
    "jose": "^4.14.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "prisma": "^5.7.1"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

With these design decisions in place, we can move to the implementation phase to build the authentication system, database schema, and channel indexing functionality for Phase 1 of the DiscordFeed project.
