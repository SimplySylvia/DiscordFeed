# Discord Feed - Progress Tracking

## Pre-Development Phase

### Setup (Completed)

- [x] Created Memory Bank structure for tracking project context (VAN mode)
- [x] Initialize Next.js project
- [x] Configure essential dependencies
- [x] Fixed package.json with correct dependencies
- [x] Installed all required dependencies with npm
- [x] Switched to Node.js v20.19.0 which is compatible with Next.js 15
- [x] Created next-env.d.ts file
- [x] Setup GitHub repository at https://github.com/SimplySylvia/DiscordFeed.git
- [x] Made initial commit with project structure and dependencies

### Design Phase (Completed)

- [x] Entered CREATIVE mode for design decisions
- [x] Designed authentication architecture (Hybrid Approach with Edge Middleware)
- [x] Designed database schema (Normalized Schema with Separate LastRead Table)
- [x] Designed channel indexing strategy (Priority-based Progressive Indexing)
- [x] Created documentation for design decisions (.memory-bank/creative-phases/)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: OAuth2 Authentication and Channel Indexing

Status: Complete

- [x] Setup Prisma schema for database models
- [x] Configure NextAuth.js with Discord provider
- [x] Set up Edge middleware for authentication
- [x] Create Login and Feed pages with React components
- [x] Implement background jobs for channel indexing
- [x] Create API endpoints for servers and preferences
- [x] Implement user preferences system UI and backend
- [x] Complete environment setup documentation
- [x] Test fully integrated authentication flow
- [x] Test channel indexing with real Discord data

### Phase 2: Message Aggregation Engine

Status: In Progress

- [x] Extend database schema for message cache, last visit tracking, webhook event tracking
- [x] Update Prisma schema and generate migration
- [x] Set up Bull queues for message fetching and cache refresh
- [x] Implement job processors: fetch-messages, refresh-cache, retry-failed
- [x] Integrate Discord API for message fetching in fetch-messages job processor
- [x] Schedule jobs based on channel priority and activity (repeatable jobs, fallback polling logic present)
- [x] Create Next.js API route for Discord webhooks (app/api/webhook/discord/route.ts)
- [x] Implement Discord webhook registration for eligible channels (lib/discord/api.ts)
- [x] Build webhook handler endpoints (Next.js API routes)
- [x] Update message cache and unread status on webhook events
- [x] Fallback to polling for channels without webhook support (placeholder logic present)
- [x] Use Redis to cache recent messages per channel/user
- [x] Track and respect Discord API rate limits in Redis (basic structure present, advanced logic TODO)
- [x] Implement cache invalidation and refresh logic (refreshChannelCache helper, used after marking as read)
- [x] Create endpoint to mark messages as read (POST /api/messages, updates DB and cache, returns unread count)
- [x] Create endpoint to fetch aggregated messages (GET /api/messages, returns latest 50 messages, unread status, unread count, uses Redis cache)
- [x] Secure endpoints with authentication and authorization (only authenticated users who are members of the server that owns the channel can access/modify messages)
- [ ] Update feed UI to display aggregated/unread messages (TODO)
- [ ] Add unread indicators and real-time update handling (TODO)
- [ ] Allow users to mark messages as read (TODO)
- [ ] Provide feedback for real-time updates (websockets or polling) (TODO)
- [ ] Unit tests for message fetching, caching, and unread logic (TODO)
- [ ] Integration tests for end-to-end aggregation and real-time updates (TODO)
- [ ] Manual testing with real Discord data (TODO)
- [ ] Update API documentation for new endpoints (TODO)
- [ ] Add user guide section for new feed/unread features (TODO)
- [ ] Document architecture and data flow for aggregation engine (TODO)
